# Covens Reborn
A magic mod for Minecraft inspired by [Witchery](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/witchery), forked from [Bewitchment](https://github.com/Um-Mitternacht/Bewitchment)

The mod is still in development, and many things are not ready to be played with.  
If you decide to try it out, regardless of this warning, please make a backup of your worlds, as I'll take no responsibility for what may happen.
